# Shōkēsu
**Shōkēsu** is a personal project to showcase various media of selected characters from anime/manga.  
It was originally built specifically for [holo.moe](http://holo.moe) (The repo was also called holo.moe!), but after grabbing another interesting domain, multi-site support was added & the name had to be changed.

#### Current Sites
* **[holo.moe](http://holo.moe)** - "Holo" from "Spice and Wolf"
* **[ruri.moe](http://ruri.moe)** - "Gokou Ruri" (more commonly known as Kuroneko) from "Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai"

## how to build
* cd build/
* npm install
* grunt update
* grunt prod

## misc
* Originally, the site was hacked together using PHP. Moved to grunt due to wanting something completely static. Think it turned out well.
* The title is a simple ENG>JP>ROMAJI translation of "Showcase". (Romaji: Shōkēsu // JP: ショーケース)
